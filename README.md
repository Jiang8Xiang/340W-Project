# 340W-Project
We will use Census and multiple other sources related to the Census to find methods of maintaining the middle class, ascend to upper class, and improve low class.

Motivation:
Socioeconomic inequality remains one of the most pressing issues in the United States. Income disparities tied to factors such as education, race, and geographic location affect millions of individuals, limiting opportunities and perpetuating cycles of poverty. At the same time insights from data and machine learning may help identify patterns that contribute to upward mobility, preserve middle class stability, and reduce poverty risk. 

Objectives:
Descriptive Analysis:
Explore datasets capturing U.S. demographics.
Calculate and visualize minimum, medium, maximum incomes across groups. 
Modeling:
Build machine learning models to predict individual or group income levels based on socioeconomic features.
Compare different algorithms.
Insights:
Identify factors most strongly associated with poverty and propose possible intervention strategies.
Analyze top earners for common drivers of financial success.
Study middle class dynamics and evaluate predictors of downward mobility.
Methods:
Data Collection:
U.S. Census Bureau
Bureau of Labor Statistics
UCI Adult Income Dataset
Possible other Datasets. 
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Distribution plots of income by race, education, religion, etc.
Correlation heat haps of socioeconomic variables.
